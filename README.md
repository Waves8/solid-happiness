# solid-happiness
Haven't had a repo to store my own developed code, things that I've found that I liked, nor things that I've used as a framework to adapt or re-work for use.
This is to try to change that!
Also, to test out doing fun things with github and pipelines.

(I also liked the randomly generated name)
