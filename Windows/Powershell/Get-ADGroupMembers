# Start of how to get all the groups in AD and their group members.
# Specifically groups with the word $Name in their name.
# Changes or improvements could be:
# parameters?
# applying standard Powershell template
# setting the results up into a variable
# exporting to a csv
# generating a report on counts of groups, members, empty groups, etc
# Breaking things down into functions (getting groups, getting group members of groups, further actions)
