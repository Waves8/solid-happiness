# From http://superuser.com/questions/333733/how-can-i-tell-which-domain-controller-im-authenticated-to
# To determine computer/server DC use NLTEST
#nltest /dsgetdc:<domain_name>

# To list all DC's with their appropriate site, try
#nltest /dclist:<domain_name>

# You don't have to use the FQDN of the domain name or server
# For example, instead of saying
#/dclist:services.microsoft.com
# You can simply type
#/dclist:services
# as long as you are an authenticated member of that domain

# For user authentication and group policy use LOGONSERVER variable
#echo %logonserver%

# Get direct reports under a manager
get-aduser $username -Properties DirectReports | select -expand DirectReports

# I had a loop for this, and it looks like I didn't document it
# recurse through each user, starting at a particular user (to obtain whole org)
# selecting different properties for the request I had
# Pretty sure I used this for a reference http://www.lazywinadmin.com/2014/10/powershell-who-reports-to-whom-active.html
