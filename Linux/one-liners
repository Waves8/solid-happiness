# Some workflow stuff via curl sending JSON
# may need to escape the double quotes in the file
# potentially, may need to also escape the doublequotes around $data?
#\"$data\"
#sed -i 's/"/\\"/g' filename
#data=$(cat filename)
#curl -v --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"startData":{"se_json":"$data"}}' "https://domain.workflowcloud.com/api/v1/workflow/published/WorkflowID/instances?token=TOKEN"

# So it turns out that perhaps instead of trying to properly figure out character expansion and special characters
# Maybe just throw it all into a file with double quotes so that --data @file.json has it all
# and the doublequotes within the query area are escaped, hurray for being lazy and dumb
# may consider creating file with the payload query
# escape the doublequotes
# then use sed to add the first line and last line to encapsulate the payload query
#{"startData":{"se_json":"
#file_contents_with_doublequotes_escaped
#"}}
